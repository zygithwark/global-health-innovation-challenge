## Project Title
Community‑Led Sanitation and Hygiene Surveillance Platform (CleanWatch)

## Problem Statement
Poor sanitation and inadequate hygiene are leading causes of diarrheal diseases, cholera, and other water‑borne illnesses that kill over 500,000 children under five annually. In many low‑income urban and rural communities, sanitation infrastructure is lacking, and existing monitoring relies on infrequent, manual surveys that miss rapid changes in contamination levels. Without real‑time, community‑generated data, outbreaks of water‑borne diseases are often detected too late, and interventions are not targeted to the most critical hotspots.

## Proposed Solution & Innovation
CleanWatch is a mobile‑first platform that empowers local residents to report sanitation and hygiene risks in real time using simple SMS or a lightweight smartphone app. The innovation includes:

1. **Citizen‑reporting tools**: Community volunteers and schoolchildren can send coded SMS messages (e.g., “CLOG 5” for a blocked drain in zone 5) or upload photos of garbage dumps, broken hand‑washing stations, or contaminated water sources.
2. **Geotagged risk mapping**: Reports are automatically plotted on a live map visible to municipal health departments, NGOs, and community leaders, with color‑coded alerts (green/yellow/red) based on severity.
3. **Gamification and incentives**: Users earn “health‑guardian points” for verified reports, redeemable for mobile airtime or small household hygiene kits, sustaining long‑term engagement.
4. **Predictive analytics**: Machine‑learning models analyze reporting patterns and environmental data (rainfall, temperature) to forecast high‑risk periods for cholera and trigger pre‑emptive clean‑up campaigns.

The platform is designed to work offline and in low‑literacy settings, with voice‑based reporting options for non‑literate users.

## Team Expertise
- **Dr. Chantal Niyonzima, Public Health Lead**: 12 years of experience in WASH (Water, Sanitation, Hygiene) programs with UNICEF in East Africa.
- **Diego Morales, Technology Lead**: Founded a social‑enterprise startup that built SMS‑based reporting tools for 50+ villages in Latin America.
- **Aisha Khan, Community Engagement Lead**: Former director of a women’s self‑help network in rural India, expert in participatory design.
- **Partnerships**: Formal collaboration with WaterAid and the Ministry of Public Health of Rwanda; advisory support from the Johns Hopkins Center for Communication Programs.

## Budget Summary

| Category | Amount (USD) | Justification |
|----------|--------------|---------------|
| Personnel | 100,000 | Salaries for 3 full‑time and 2 part‑time staff for 12 months |
| Mobile Technology & SMS Gateway | 40,000 | Bulk SMS credits, app‑development costs, server hosting |
| Community Incentives & Training | 35,000 | Hygiene kits, airtime rewards, workshop materials |
| Monitoring & Evaluation | 15,000 | Third‑party impact assessment, data‑analysis consultants |
| Contingency | 10,000 | Unforeseen local partnership costs |
| **Total** | **200,000** | |

## Expected Impact on Prevention
- **Disease reduction**: Aim to cut diarrheal‑disease incidence by 40% in pilot communities within one year through faster response to sanitation hazards.
- **Early outbreak detection**: Enable health authorities to identify cholera hotspots 2–3 weeks earlier than traditional surveillance.
- **Community empowerment**: Train and equip 500 “health guardians” (60% women) to become permanent watchdogs for sanitation in their neighborhoods.
- **Scalability**: The model can be adapted to any low‑resource setting; we aim to reach 1 million people across 5 countries within 3 years.

## Timeline
- **Months 1‑3**: Co‑design platform with community focus groups, develop MVP.
- **Months 4‑6**: Pilot launch in 20 urban neighborhoods in Kigali, Rwanda.
- **Months 7‑9**: Expand to rural districts, integrate predictive analytics.
- **Months 10‑12**: Final evaluation, produce open‑source toolkit for replication.

## Additional Information
All data collected will be owned by the participating communities and shared with local health authorities under a data‑governance agreement that prioritizes privacy and informed consent. The project aligns with SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) and the WHO’s Guidelines on Sanitation and Health.
