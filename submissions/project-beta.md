## Project Title
AI‑Powered Early Warning System for Zoonotic Spillover (AI‑ZooWatch)

## Problem Statement
Over 75% of emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic, originating from animal‑to‑human transmission. Current surveillance systems are fragmented, slow, and often rely on reported human cases, which means outbreaks are detected only after significant community spread. In many high‑risk regions (e.g., the Congo Basin, Southeast Asia), limited laboratory capacity, weak animal‑health reporting, and a lack of real‑time data integration hinder early detection. This delay allows pathogens such as Ebola, Nipah, and novel coronaviruses to gain a foothold, leading to costly and devastating epidemics.

## Proposed Solution & Innovation
AI‑ZooWatch is a cloud‑based platform that continuously analyzes multiple streams of ecological, epidemiological, and social‑media data to predict and flag high‑risk zones for zoonotic spillover. The innovation comprises:

1. **Multimodal data fusion**: Ingests satellite imagery (land‑use change, deforestation), climate data (temperature, humidity), wildlife‑trade reports, livestock‑health databases, and anonymized social‑media posts mentioning unusual animal deaths or human symptoms.
2. **Deep‑learning models** trained on historical outbreak patterns that assign a “spillover risk score” to each 10×10 km grid cell, updated daily.
3. **Automated alerts** sent to local health authorities, veterinarians, and community health workers via SMS and a low‑bandwidth mobile app, prompting targeted field investigations.

The system is designed to be interoperable with existing national surveillance frameworks and will be provided as open‑source software to encourage global adaptation.

## Team Expertise
- **Dr. Ahmed Hassan, Lead Epidemiologist**: Former head of the WHO’s zoonotic disease unit, 15 years of field experience in Africa and Asia.
- **Sophie Müller, Data Scientist**: PhD in computational biology, built early‑warning models for the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.
- **Ravi Patel, Software Architect**: Previously led backend development at the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN).
- **Partnerships**: Collaboration with the One Health Institute at UC Davis and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE).

## Budget Summary

| Category | Amount (USD) | Justification |
|----------|--------------|---------------|
| Personnel | 180,000 | Salaries for 4 full‑time staff for 18 months |
| Cloud Infrastructure & Computing | 40,000 | AWS/GCP credits, data‑storage costs |
| Field Deployment & Training | 35,000 | Workshops in 3 pilot countries, travel, per‑diems |
| Software Development & Licenses | 25,000 | API subscriptions, security audits |
| Contingency | 20,000 | Unforeseen data‑acquisition expenses |
| **Total** | **300,000** | |

## Expected Impact on Prevention
- **Early detection**: Reduce the average time from spillover event to outbreak recognition from weeks to days.
- **Outbreak prevention**: Enable pre‑emptive interventions (e.g., culling of infected livestock, community education) that could avert at least 2–3 major zoonotic outbreaks per year.
- **Capacity building**: Train 200 local health and veterinary workers in digital surveillance tools, strengthening national One Health platforms.
- **Global scalability**: The platform can be extended to cover 50 high‑risk countries within 5 years, creating a global “immune system” against emerging pathogens.

## Timeline
- **Months 1‑4**: Data‑pipeline development, model training on historical datasets.
- **Months 5‑8**: Pilot deployment in Uganda, Vietnam, and Brazil.
- **Months 9‑12**: Iterative refinement based on pilot feedback.
- **Months 13‑18**: Expansion to two additional regions, publication of open‑source code and validation studies.
