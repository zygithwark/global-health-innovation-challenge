# Global Health Innovation Challenge Application

## Project Title
Mobile Vaccine Delivery Drones for Remote Areas (MVD-Drones)

## Problem Statement
Many remote and hard‑to‑reach communities, especially in sub‑Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia, lack reliable access to life‑saving vaccines due to inadequate road infrastructure, limited cold‑chain capacity, and high last‑mile delivery costs. As a result, routine immunization coverage drops below 50% in some regions, leaving populations vulnerable to preventable diseases such as measles, polio, and COVID‑19. Current delivery models rely on refrigerated trucks and motorbikes, which are often unavailable, expensive, or unable to cross difficult terrain during rainy seasons. This gap in vaccine equity directly contributes to preventable outbreaks and undermines global epidemic preparedness.

## Proposed Solution & Innovation
We propose a fleet of lightweight, autonomous drones equipped with temperature‑controlled payload compartments that can deliver vaccines, essential medicines, and diagnostic samples to remote health clinics within a 100‑km radius. The innovation lies in:
1. **AI‑powered route optimization** that adapts to weather, terrain, and air‑traffic constraints in real time.
2. **Ultra‑portable solar‑powered charging stations** deployed at community health centers, enabling 24/7 operations without grid electricity.
3. **Blockchain‑based inventory tracking** that ensures end‑to‑end cold‑chain integrity and prevents stock‑outs.

Our drones are built on open‑source hardware and software, allowing local technicians to maintain and repair them with minimal external support. The system integrates with existing national immunization registries to automatically update vaccination records.

## Team Expertise
- **Dr. Maria Chen, Project Lead**: PhD in Biomedical Engineering, 10 years of experience designing medical drones for Médecins Sans Frontières.
- **James Omondi, Logistics Lead**: Former head of supply chain for the Kenya Red Cross, expert in last‑mile delivery in East Africa.
- **Priya Sharma, Software Lead**: Machine‑learning engineer who previously built routing algorithms for Amazon Prime Air.
- **Partnerships**: We have letters of support from the Ministry of Health of Uganda and the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI).

## Budget Summary

| Category | Amount (USD) | Justification |
|----------|--------------|---------------|
| Personnel | 120,000 | Salaries for 3 full‑time staff for 12 months |
| Equipment & Materials | 80,000 | 10 drones, spare parts, charging stations |
| Travel & Logistics | 25,000 | Field deployments, training workshops |
| Software & Licenses | 15,000 | Cloud hosting, security certificates |
| Contingency | 10,000 | Unforeseen repairs, currency fluctuations |
| **Total** | **250,000** | |

## Expected Impact on Prevention
- **Direct protection**: Reach 50,000 additional children with routine vaccines in Year 1, increasing coverage from 45% to 85% in pilot districts.
- **Outbreak reduction**: Cut measles transmission by an estimated 60% by ensuring timely second‑dose delivery.
- **System strengthening**: Build local capacity for drone operations and data‑driven supply‑chain management.
- **Scalability**: The model can be replicated across 20+ low‑income countries within 3 years, potentially protecting millions from vaccine‑preventable diseases.

## Timeline
- **Months 1‑2**: Finalize drone design, secure regulatory approvals.
- **Months 3‑5**: Build and test prototype drones in controlled environment.
- **Months 6‑8**: Pilot deployment in two remote districts of Uganda.
- **Months 9‑12**: Evaluate impact, refine system, produce open‑source documentation.

## Additional Information
All flight data will be anonymized and shared publicly to advance research on drone‑based health logistics. The project adheres to WHO guidelines for drone use in health care and has undergone an ethical review by an independent board.
