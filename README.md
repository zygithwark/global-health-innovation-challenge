- **Early Warning Systems**: Tools for detecting and monitoring emerging health threats.
- **Citizen‑Led Health Monitoring**: Platforms that empower communities to track and report health data.
- **Resilient Health Systems**: Solutions that strengthen healthcare infrastructure, especially in low‑resource settings.
- **Disease Prevention**: Interventions that stop the spread of infectious diseases at the source.

4. **Place your completed application** inside the `submissions/` directory of your fork.
5. **Submit a pull request** from your fork to the `main` branch of this repository.
